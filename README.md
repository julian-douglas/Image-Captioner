# Image Captioner

Welcome to my image captioner!

This is a small project that uses FastAPI and Transformers to take in an image from the user, and generate a caption for it using AI. 

In order to run this, open a new terminal window. Then:
- `pip install uvicorn`
- `git clone https://github.com/julian-douglas/Image-Captioner.git`
- `cd Image-Captioner`
- `uvicorn application:app --reload`

Wait for the terminal to say `Application startup complete.`. Then:
- navigate to https://julian-douglas.github.io/Image-Captioner/
- upload an image and enjoy!
